/**
 * Outputs resolvable source (task 007).
 *
 * Exposes stored outputs through the MCP resource path so
 * `nb__read_resource(files://<id>)` resolves a past output. `read_resource`
 * already iterates every `McpSource` calling `readResource(uri)` and returns
 * the first hit (see `src/tools/system-tools.ts`); this source plugs into that
 * loop via a `resourceHandler` — there is NO parallel resolver here.
 *
 * Why a dedicated source rather than relying on the `files` source: the local
 * output backend writes into the identity-owned file store, so its outputs
 * already resolve through `files`. The DATAPLANE backend's outputs live in the
 * artifacts service — a `files://<artifactId>` ref has no entry in the local
 * file store and would 404 there. This source resolves through the active
 * `OutputStore`, so the SAME `files://` ref resolves for both backends.
 *
 * This is the bounded "peek": `read_resource` applies its existing 12K cap to
 * the returned text (motivating `nb__get_output` for the full body). The
 * handler returns the whole body; the cap is applied by the read_resource tool,
 * exactly as it is for every other source.
 *
 * Registered only when an output-store provider resolves (dataplane | local),
 * mirroring how `deepResearchCtx` / `getOutputCtx` gate their surfaces. When the
 * provider is `null` the source is absent.
